My first shot with Relay Modern and GraphQL

# Prerequisites

```
    npm 5
    node 6+
```

# Install

`npm install`
`npm run update-schema` to update grahpql schema
`npm run relay` to generate graphql queries
`npm run server` runs graphql server
`npm run start` runs aplication
`npm run e2e` runs end-to-end tests

# Notes

If you try to send empty note server will return error.
Application will correctly handle and show it.
Else try to send note in offline mode.
